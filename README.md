# ignition-and-check-control
this is a creation of my ignition starter inturrupt and recreation of my check control display.

My name is Josh Johnson and I'm fairly new to programming. I've dabbled a bit in html and some php coding with my website and ive been looking at code for as long as I can remember but its taken me until the age of 40 to commit to programming. With the desire and the goal of creating an ignition setup for my 1985 BMW 635CSi, I'm hoping the time spent on this keeps my mind free from the Coronavirus madness that has gripped the world and locked us down into our homes.
